In the land of Sempera, the rich control everything - even time. Ever since the age of alchemy and sorcery, hours, days and years have been extracted from blood and bound to iron coins. The rich live for centuries; the poor bleed themselves dry.

Everless: Book 1 by Sara Holland Book Review

Name: The Blonde Likes Books
Rating: 4.0 out of 5 stars
Title: I really liked Everless, and I loved the concept
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2018
Review: All in all, I really liked Everless, and I loved the concept! I've heard it compared to the movie In Time, which I've never seen, so it was a really unique plot to me, which I loved. I was hooked right away, and I found the book really easy to read. The pacing was great, and I never found myself getting bored.

I also loved the characters and the character development - I had some theories pretty early in the book, and I was right about some of them, but there were also some twists in the book which I didn't see coming but totally loved!

The one qualm I had with the book was that SO many of the issues could have been resolved with communication! For example, the main character Jules has always heard about her dad talk about how she needs to avoid Everless, and then specifically tells her never to let the queen see her or touch her, but never tells her WHY, so naturally being a teenage girl, she takes it upon herself to find out. If he'd just told her from the beginning, many of the plot points would have been non-issues. I know the lack of communication was needed in order to drive the plot in a specific way, but I felt it could have been done differently, and I would have liked it better - lack of communication that causes issues are always a pet peeve for me in books!

All in all, I loved the book and rated it 4.5 stars! I can't wait for the sequel!

Title: So much promise, but didn't deliver
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2019
Review: I thought the story concept was excellent, but the book really fell short. There were so many times in the story where the author did not do a good enough job of creating backstory, or developing plot lines. For example, we learn that the main character can stop time. You get an initial glimpse of this within the first 5 pages, then you don't hear anything about it again until over 100+ pages in. If this is so important, there should be breadcrumbs along the way, guiding toward the eventual plot twist. Instead it was like nothing, nothing, nothing, bam!...big new concept. It felt like this throughout the story. There were other times where the main character would discover something new and would say "this felt familiar and feels like this should be important to me." But there was nothing within the story (up until those points), that would lead the reader to believe her - again no subtle breadcrumbs guiding the reader and gently leading the reader down the path. I wouldn't recommend this book, I gave two stars for a promising concept.

Title: Interesting concept but ultimately not very engaging.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2018
Review: I gave it 3 stars because I did finish it but it was very predictable. The author didn't really do anything with the time is money hook. You could slot almost anything in its place and barely tell the difference. The protagonist wasn't very likable or clever and the supporting characters weren't well fleshed out. There just wasn't anyone I cared about. This is clearly book 1 of whatever. Perhaps the author will grow in her craft. I think she has promise but she's not there in this book. Unfortunately she hasn't persuaded me to be there for the next one.

Title: I need book 2 already!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2018
Review: I was very skeptical going into Everless. There were so many mixed reviews that I put off reading it until now even though I had the book sitting on my bookshelf since it came out last month.

I was swept up by this book! It held my attention from the get go. When I wasn‚Äôt reading it, I was thinking about it. Wondering all the ‚ÄòWhat if?‚Äô scenarios that could happen. In short, I loved it.

Everless is about a world where blood rules everything. It‚Äôs like currency. Blood is made into blood coins that can be used to give you more time in life. (I know I‚Äôm probably doing a terrible job at explaining)

Our main character Jules has been watching her father get sicker and sicker because he is giving more of his time to pay for their life. In order to keep him alive, Jules takes a servant job at the Everless estate. The same estate that Jules and her father used to live before they were chased away years ago. Even though her father has always warned away from Everless she goes anyway because they need the blood coins. Once she gets there, she realizes that the estate is full of secrets.

 I loved the mystery of the story. I couldn‚Äôt predict anything that was going to happen! The twist in Everless really threw me for a loop. All the predictions I made were WAY OFF! Once everything came to light, it was awesome! I'm fangirling right now and I don't care at all. I liked Jules as a protagonist. She was clever and didn't back down from anything. I also liked brooding Liam. I couldn't figure out what role he was going to play in this book. I hope we get more of him in the next book. 

The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars was because of the romance between Jules and Roan. The story didn‚Äôt need it. Well I could see why they put it there, but I didn‚Äôt need it. It really seemed irrelevant to the story. 

‚Üí FINAL THOUGHTS
I loved it, I recommend it, and please go read it if you haven't! Let's talk about it!

Title: Jules was an amazing character and I was sucked into her world from ...
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2018
Review: Wow. That‚Äôs the first thing I can say about this book. It was phenomenal! Jules was an amazing character and I was sucked into her world from the first page. Jules decides to go back to Everless ‚Äì a place she was kicked out of ‚Äì to try to save her father. There she starts to learn more about her past and the danger she really is in. I loved the world building in this story! Everless is a place that is intriguing and dangerous! Jules history at Everless is also intriguing. She remembers things differently than she thought she did You also get to meet the Gerling‚Äôs two boys Roan and Liam (Liam is a new book boyfriend of mine!). Liam is the mean one while Roan is the golden one. I loved the character development of one of the boys (I won‚Äôt say which one!) while the other left me kind of bleh. That ending though! I loved the ending and just can‚Äôt wait to get more from this world! It‚Äôs on my list of favorite series now! Check this book out if you like a different type of fantastical world where blood is time!

Thank you to Edelweiss and Harper Teen for a free eARC of this book in exchange for my honest review!
